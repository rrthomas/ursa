Ursa is intended to be a friendly, stable general-purpose programming
language and runtime: the sort of language you can easily start writing code
in, where the code and runtime will still work decades later. For more
details, see the [rationale](https://ursalang.github.io/rationale.html).

Currently, Ursa is under development, as reflected in the version number.
The intention is that once it reaches version 1, the language will not
change or evolve further.

Ursa is free software, licensed under the GNU GPL version 3 (or, at your
option, any later version), and written in TypeScript.

Please [ask questions, make comments](https://ursalang.github.io/discussions.html);
you can [open bug reports](https://github.com/ursalang/ursa/issues) on our GitHub issue tracker.
